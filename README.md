# **Student Management Database**

This project provides a simple system for managing student data using a relational database. It allows you to perform basic operations like adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving student information.

## **How to Run:**

1. **Set Up the Database:**
   - Make sure you have a relational database (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) set up and the necessary database credentials configured in the project.

2. **Run the Java Program:**
   - Navigate to the `JDBC/src/jdbc/` directory.
   - Run the `JDBC.java` file to connect to the database and perform the necessary student management operations:
   ```bash
   javac JDBC.java
   java JDBC
   ```

3. **Database Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the database configuration (username, password, and URL) is set correctly in the Java file to connect to your database.
